# Example Segmentflow .yaml Input File
#
# Instructions and Notes:
# 1) The two directories are the location of the data set you'd like to segement, and the directory into which
#    you'd like to output the .stl files.
# 2) 'STL Prefix' is the non-unique, first part of the output .stl file names after which the particle number is 
#    appended.
# 3) If 'Particle ID' is not set (i.e. left blank), Segmentflow will automatically produce .stl files for every 
#    particle in the volume selected via the three crops in 'Image'. If 'Particle ID' is set to an integer, 
#    segmentflow will only produce an .stl for that particle. Care must be taken to select a particle ID that is 
#    available as it's currently unclear how well the error catching works.
# 4) Interact Mode: Segmentflow will provide a few plots to track your progress if you change "Segment" to "True".
#    "STL Writer" set to "False" will port to the standard output a list of all the .stl files being written. Sorry
#    the boolean convention between the two inputs is backwards...
# 5) Details of the "Image" inputs can be found in the descriptions of their relevant functions in "segment.py".
#    See load_images(), binarize_multiotsu(), watershed_segment(), plot_segment_steps(), marching_cubes(), and 
#    save_stl().
